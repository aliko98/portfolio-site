					<h2 class="entry-title">Logo Design: Brand identity for a Photographer</h2>
					
					<p>I designed this logo for a logo design contest and was one of five finalists in the last round. The contest holder wanted the logo to look clean but rugged and desired a slightly distressed style. The logo also needed to be gender neutral, sophisticated, and a bit luxurious.</p>
					<p>This led to choosing a neutral type with clean lines but that also looked weathered. The design idea for the icon was inspired by the letter M. The result is a logo that is mature and sophisticated yet unpretentious.  </p>
