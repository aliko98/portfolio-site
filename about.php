						<p class="bio">Everyone has a story to share. Since 2012 I have been helping individuals and organizations tell their stories - a new development, a new product, a new direction. Through the materials I design for them, whether it be print or digital, my aim is to ensure these stories are shared in a visually appealing and effective manner. Both aesthetics and practicality inform my approach to design. I enjoy collaborating with clients in coming up with creative solutions for their design needs and helping them achieve the success they seek. Every project I take on, no matter how big or small, receives my utmost attention and care.<br><br>
						
					Currently Iâ€™m working as a full-time graphic designer at <a href="https://www.ssulive.com/" target="_blank">Support Services Unlimited</a> where I spend most of my time designing/coding html emails and creating print/digital collateral for our nonprofit clients. <br><br>

					I studied graphic design at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, BC, where I live with my husband and toddler. For the time being I am accepting a limited amount of freelance work.
